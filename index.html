        <h3>Process Breakdown</h3>
        <p> 
            Our process relied on using standard image preproccessing to prepare a chosen text 
            then passing it through the pytesseract ocr sysytem to obtain a basic first pass of the text. 
            We then passed text as well as the data from the ocr scan through a function that checked the 
            confidence score of each word as well whether that word contained a known polyglyph in our system.
            If a word came back with both a confidence score below a targeted threshold and came back containing
            a known polyglyph then word would be ran through a function to compare the probability of each of the 
            characters in that polyglyph set to see which was most likely based on data found in our bigram and trigram
            data sets. 
        </p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Preproccessing</h4>
            <p>
                <i><b>1. Grey Scaling</b></i><br/>
                The initial step for properly scanning in the text. Colors are muted to render
                 the image in grey scale in preperation for the conversion to black and white.<br/>
                <i><b>2. Black & White Conversion</b></i><br/>
                A nececary step as the OCR system is trained to best recognize characters in black on a white 
                background. Our system defines a threshold and any colors below that shade are pushed to white
                while those above are pushed to pure black optimizining the scanning proccess. <br/>
                <i><b>3. Noise Removal</b></i><br/>
                While not strictly nececary the removal of noise and blur helps to reduce issues caused
                by small particles or inconsistencies present on the scanned text.
                <i><b>(Optional) Text Allignment</b></i><br/>
                This is not required for every text as many are already vertically oriented however since OCR systems are designed to
                recognize text in a verticle orientation this can be a neccesity.It helps to adjest text that is slanted at extreme 
                angles or slightly warped attempting to place them in a more proper format. When nececary for a text this 
                step is applied first before running the text through the other preproccessing steps.<br/>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Context based letter baising</h4>
            <p>
                This is the core of our project. It focuses on correcting OCR based on letter combination frequency
                in a similar way to how humans actually read and proccess ambiguos text. This is done by
                taking the ambiguos letter and the letters around it in a word. We take the polyglyph character and
                combine it in three diffrent combinations. First the character and the 2 prior to it, 
                then the character and the 2 after it, and finally the character as well as one before and one after it.
                Taking these three sets allows us to further optimize are statistical data to get the correct character.
                Our system will only take 3 letter combinations if the text does not contain white space in the chosen space.
                In the event that only 2 letters are taken then we will simply take a two letter block, however 
                if only one letter is gather such as if the ambiguos letter is at the begining or end of a word then
                that set is ignored for that execution of the function. After that the letter combination are each have the ambiguos
                letter changed to use its other homoglyphs. Then each of these alternatives is compared to the statistical commonality
                of that letter combination within our datasets.(<a href="https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2014/09/26/bigrams.html">

       <h2> Full Example: "Monday's Child"</h2>     
        <p>
            This example is a scanning of a print writing of the English nursery rhyme Monday's Child(written below for context).
            It has been loaded through the system and processed giving the following results. <br/> <br/>
            <i>Monday's child is fair of face<br/>
            Tuesday's child is full of grace<br/>
            Wednsday's child is full of woe<br/>
            Thurssday's child has far to go<br/>
            Friday's child is loving and giving<br/>
            Saturday's child works hard for a living<br/>
            The child born on the Sabbath Day<br/>
            Is bonny and blithe and good and gay<br/></i>
